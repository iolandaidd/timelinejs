       Ten years later, in 1982, Howard Schultz joins Starbucks as a director of Retail Operations and Marketing 
     After Schultz travels to Italy, he started to develop a similar coffeehouse 
        culture in Seattle and in 1984, Starbucks served their first Caff√® Latte. With that,
        it kept becoming everyday more popular, and in 1990 Starbucks expands headquarters in Seattle. 
        At that time, starbucks didn't have a proper
        menu, the store would sell bulk coffee beans, tea, and spices, the brewed coffee would be given as a sample for costumers at that time. 
        In the late 1980s, specifically 1986, Starbucks invented their first holiday menu, the guy responsible for the first holiday drink was Dave Olsen, he 
        simply put some ingredients together and came up with eggnogg latte, which in that time was a total success for the holidays.  
        In 1990s, Starbucks opened 2,498 stores around the world, including first licensed airport store (Seattle), first drive-through location, 
        and first store outside of the US (Japan in 96) before rolling out global stores, in the UK, Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand, China, Kuwait, and Lebanon, among others.
