            Starbucks coffee shop was founded in 1971 in Seattle's Pike place Market, 
        by  Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker. The three founders first met 
        at University of San Francisco. The brand's name was inspired by the classic tale, "Moby-Dick"
        making reference to the tradition of the early coffee traders
    
        
            The tradition of selling coffe was inspired by Alfred Peet, who was known for roasting
            his coffee beans, with that, the three founders of starbucks decided to sell high-quality coffee 
          made in good machines.Throughout the year of 1970 and 1971, the owners were selling roasted coffee beans like water, providing
        a grossing of US$46,832 in the first nine months of opened stores, at that time the total was 4 stores opened in the US.
